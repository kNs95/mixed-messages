# Your New Monster
> This is a Javascript program that outputs "your new random monster" each time it is run in Node.js. This is what I came up with for Mixed-Messages project from Codecademy course.

## General Information
> This program will randomly choose 1 out of 30 possible "Monster Names" for your new monster. It will then specify the type for your new monster (1 out of 10 available types).
Once the type for your monster is set, the program will then choose 1 skill for your monster depending on your monster's type (each type has 3 different skills and the program 
will choose 1 of them).

## Technologies Used
* Visual Studio Code - ver. 1.53.2
* Node.js
* Git Bash - ver. 2.30.0.windows.2

## Setup
> Run the random-mixed-messages.js in Node.js and it will show you the output with your new monster and its details.
